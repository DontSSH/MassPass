# Welcome to MassPass!

## **Intro**

Welcome! Thank you for helping support the MassPass IOS project, here we are 
trying to make a serverless application that runs on any type of IOS device, allowing
for all passwords to be shared using secure methods!

How are we going to do this? Well, it's easy, as long as MassPass is able to locally store the data
on all the devices that it's connected to. To do this, a user would need to have their devices charged,
how do we get around this? Look at our **Sharing Data** page to review how we are planning to do this.

We are trying to make this Application FREE, to do this we need to be able to work together as our team is new
to **Swift** and we have trouble working on our front-end development. If you are interested in the "back-end"
information, look at our **Back-end** documentation!
